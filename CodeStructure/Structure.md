# Code structure 

## Comments

### Bad Comments

in normal all the comments are in a bad way. 

There are many problems and we point some of them.

- Redundant information

  If you choose proper name why do  you need a comment to explain your code in redundant way ??

  **For Example** :

  you have 4 line of code and you have commented for each one so if you want to explain each line why did you try to have a good naming properties ? 

  With extra comment you make your code harder to read!!!!!!

- Wrong Comments 

- Commented-out Code 

  ​	If you have a *Comment* out of your code and if it's not necessary just remove it.

  

- Dividers/Block for making beautiful code

  ​	Sometimes in a code some one for inform the other people try to make a block with `#` sign like the example : 

  ```python
  #########
  # Global VAr
  #########
  ```

  These are redundant information ,  This makes  your code Harder to read, so avoid to make your code divide like 

  the above example.

  

  ### Good Comments

  - Legal comments

    ​	Comments that add information about author or legal info at the top of the CODE.

  - Explanations which can't replaced with good naming

    ​	*in the above  example you have a `Regex` in your code and you can't have a good name for your variable so 	you need to make a comment.*

  - Comments that Warn You

  - To-do Comments

    ```python
    def findOne():
        # Todo: Needs to be implemented.
        pass
    ```



## Code-Formatting

we have two types of formatting:

- Horizontal : Lines of code should be readable without scrolling (avoid very long sentences)

  - indention : use indention for readable code.
  - Line Width   (break the statement to multiple line of shorter code )
  - Space Between code

  

- Vertical  :  your code should be readable like an essay to to bottom without any `Jumps` 

  - Space between lines 
  - Grouping of Code
